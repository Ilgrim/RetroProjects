INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a small package containing some useful tools for
the screen of the Amstrad computers (CPC & PCW) in CP/M.

As the Amstrad CP/M screen emulates a VT52, they can be
useful for other CP/M computers too.

CLS              --  To clear the screen.
CURSOR ON | OFF  --  To show / hide the screen cursor.
STLINE ON | OFF  --  To show / hide the screen status line.
